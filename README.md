This ddev add-on helps you to manage your theme build processes in Magento total easy. You can run a build command to build all your themes or a specific theme. Don't matter if the theme is a Magento Standard or Custom Theme, or maybe a Hyva theme. It automatically takes care which type of theme you use and will build it for you. If a dependency is missing, Woodoo will install it.

_>> Build all your Magento themes at once, with Magic, build with Woodoo!_
